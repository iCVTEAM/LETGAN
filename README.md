How to Learn a Domain Adaptive Event Simulator? ACM MM 2021

------

## Running Environment:

pytorch=1.4, 1 NVIDIA-1080TI. More details can be found in paper.

------

## Easy Start:

Download [model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NKKxkkipf3XYZ7K3SKSgRQ)(code:m0f2).  and add the folder into the "Model" folder.

run command "python inference.py". Note that configs should be prepared in "inferenceOptions.py" and data should be prepared as folder "Data"
.<!--Note that some configs should be prepared as [
esim_config_generator
](https://github.com/TimoStoff/esim_config_generator). before running.-->

## Acknowledgement:

Some of our code is based on the implementation of [event_cnn_minimal](https://github.com/TimoStoff/event_cnn_minimal), and [Event Contrast Maximization Library](https://github.com/TimoStoff/events_contrast_maximization).
