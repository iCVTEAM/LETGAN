How to Learn a Domain Adaptive Event Simulator? ACM MM 2021

------

## Running Environment:

pytorch=1.4, 1 NVIDIA-1080TI. More details can be found in paper.

------

## Easy Start:

Download [model](http://cvteam.net/projects/2021/Gard/dataset_split.zip).  and add the folder into the "Model" folder.

run command "python inference.py". Note that some configs should be prepared as [model](http://cvteam.net/projects/2021/Gard/dataset_split.zip). before running.
